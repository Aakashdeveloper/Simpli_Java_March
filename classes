Java is Object oriented language

Object encapsulate data, operations and usage semantics
> Allows stroage and manipulation details to be hidden
> Separte "what" is to be done from "how" it is done


Classes

A class is made up of both state and executable code
-fields
    > Store object state
-Method
    > executable codethat manipulates state and performs operations
- Constructors
    >executable code used during object creation to set inital state

Flight.Java

class Flight{
    int passengers;
    int seats;

    Flight(){
        seats = 150;
        passengers =0
    }

    void add1Passenger(){
        if(passengers < seats){
            passengers +=1
        }
    }
}

With new keyword we create instance/object of class;

Flight nycToSf;
nycToSf = new Flight();

Flight slcToDallas = new Flight()
slcToDallas.add1Passenger()

Public  => Everywhere
Private => Only within the own class


public class Flight{
    private int passengers;
    private int seats;

    public Flight(){
        seats = 150;
        passengers =0
    }

    public void add1Passenger(){
        if(passengers < seats){
            passengers +=1
        }else{
            handleToMany()
        }
    }

    private void handleToMany(){
        System.out.println("TOo many passengers")
    }
}

Flight flight1 = new Flight();
flight1.add1Passenger();
flight1.handleToMany() //not accesible
